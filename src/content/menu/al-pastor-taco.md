Our signature Al Pastor tacos are a Mexico City street food classic brought to life. We marinate tender pork shoulder for 24 hours in a blend of dried chilies, achiote, pineapple juice, and aromatic spices, then slow-roast it on a vertical trompo until the edges are perfectly caramelized.

Each taco is crowned with fresh pineapple chunks that have been kissed by the flames, adding a sweet and smoky contrast to the savory meat. We finish with finely chopped white onion, fresh cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice, all nestled in warm, handmade corn tortillas.

The heat comes from our house-made salsa roja, featuring roasted árbol and guajillo chilies that provide a pleasant burn without overwhelming the complex flavors of the meat. This is the taco that made us famous – one bite and you'll understand why.
