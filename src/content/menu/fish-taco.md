Transport yourself to the beaches of Baja California with our crispy fish tacos. We start with fresh tilapia fillets, dipped in our secret beer batter made with Mexican lager and a hint of lime zest, then fried to golden perfection.

The fish is nestled in warm flour tortillas and topped with our signature purple and green cabbage slaw, tossed lightly in lime juice and sea salt for the perfect crunch. A generous drizzle of our house-made chipotle mayo adds creamy richness with just a whisper of smoke.

We finish each taco with fresh pico de gallo – ripe tomatoes, white onion, jalapeño, and cilantro – and serve with lime wedges on the side. The combination of textures and flavors creates the perfect bite: crispy, creamy, fresh, and bright. It's summer at the beach, any day of the year.
