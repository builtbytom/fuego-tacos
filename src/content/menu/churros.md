Our churros are made to order, ensuring you get them at their absolute best – piping hot, crispy outside, and tender inside. We pipe the traditional ridged dough directly into hot oil, where it fries to golden perfection in just minutes.

The moment they emerge from the oil, we toss them in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar that clings to every ridge and crevice. The cinnamon we use is true Ceylon cinnamon – sweeter and more complex than common cassia – mixed with fine granulated sugar for the perfect coating.

What elevates our churros from street fair snack to restaurant dessert is the accompaniment: warm cajeta. This traditional Mexican caramel is made from goat's milk, cooked slowly until it becomes thick and luscious with notes of vanilla and a subtle tang that sets it apart from regular caramel.

Served immediately on a warm plate with the cajeta in a small dish for dipping, our churros are a study in contrasts: crispy and creamy, cinnamon-spiced and caramel-sweet, hot and warm. One order comes with four generous churros – perfect for sharing, though you might not want to.
