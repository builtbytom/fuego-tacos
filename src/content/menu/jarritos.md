No taco experience is complete without the colorful, festive bottles of Jarritos lining our cooler. These iconic Mexican sodas have been crafted with real sugar since 1950, delivering authentic fruit flavors that pair perfectly with our food.

We stock all the classics: tangy Tamarind with its sweet-sour complexity, bright Mandarin (orange) that's like sunshine in a bottle, refreshing Lime that's tarter than any American lemon-lime soda, tropical Pineapple that transports you to the beach, and vibrant Fruit Punch that's a fiesta in your mouth.

Each Jarritos is made with natural fruit flavors and real cane sugar – never high fructose corn syrup. The difference is remarkable: cleaner, more authentic fruit taste without the cloying sweetness of typical sodas. The carbonation is gentler too, with smaller bubbles that enhance rather than mask the flavors.

Served ice-cold in the bottle with a wedge of lime (because everything's better with lime), Jarritos are more than just sodas – they're a nostalgic taste of Mexico that perfectly complements the bold flavors of our tacos. Pro tip: Tamarind with al pastor, Lime with fish tacos, and Pineapple with anything spicy.
