Our horchata is a labor of love that starts the night before you drink it. We soak white rice with real Ceylon cinnamon sticks (never powder) and blanched almonds, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to soften completely.

In the morning, we blend this mixture with fresh water until it's completely smooth, then strain it through cheesecloth multiple times until we achieve that signature silky texture. We sweeten it with pure cane sugar and a touch of vanilla, creating a drink that's creamy despite containing no dairy.

Served over ice in a tall glass, our horchata is the perfect cooling complement to spicy tacos. The sweet cinnamon and subtle nuttiness refresh your palate between bites, while the creamy texture soothes any heat from our salsas.

This traditional agua fresca has been made the same way for centuries, and we honor that tradition. One sip and you'll understand why horchata has been Mexico's favorite non-alcoholic beverage for generations. It's refreshing, satisfying, and utterly unique â€“ there's simply nothing else like it.
