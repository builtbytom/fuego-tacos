Our Barbacoa is a weekend tradition worth waiting for. We take premium beef cheek and marinate it overnight in a blend of guajillo chilies, Mexican oregano, cumin, cloves, and bay leaves. Then we wrap it in banana leaves and slow-cook it for 8 hours until it's so tender it melts on your tongue.

The meat is incredibly rich and flavorful, with a silky texture that can only be achieved through patient, traditional cooking methods. We serve it simply – on warm corn tortillas with fresh cilantro and diced white onion – letting the meat shine.

What sets our barbacoa apart is the small cup of consommé we serve alongside. This deeply flavorful broth, collected from the cooking process and seasoned to perfection, is perfect for dipping your taco or sipping between bites. It's a tradition from Hidalgo that transforms a great taco into an unforgettable experience. Limited quantities available daily – when it's gone, it's gone.
