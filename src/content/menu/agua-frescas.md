Our agua frescas are made fresh every morning, capturing the essence of ripe fruit in its purest form. These traditional Mexican "fresh waters" are light, refreshing, and naturally hydrating – the perfect antidote to a hot day or spicy meal.

Our rotating selection always includes classics like Jamaica (hibiscus), with its gorgeous ruby color and tart, cranberry-like flavor that's rich in vitamin C. Tamarindo offers a more complex profile – sweet, sour, and slightly earthy, made from the pulp of tamarind pods.

Seasonal offerings might include sweet-tart Agua de Piña (pineapple), creamy Agua de Melón (cantaloupe), or refreshing Agua de Sandía (watermelon) with a hint of lime. Each is made by blending fresh fruit with water, straining, and lightly sweetening to let the natural flavors shine.

Served over ice in large glasses with fresh fruit garnishes, our aguas frescas are substantially more refreshing than heavy sodas or juices. They're the beverages Mexican families have been making for generations – simple, natural, and perfectly balanced. Ask your server about today's selections, and don't be surprised if you find yourself ordering a second glass.
