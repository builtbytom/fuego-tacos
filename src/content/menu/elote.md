Our elote brings the magic of Mexican street vendors right to your table. We start with sweet corn on the cob, grilled over an open flame until the kernels are slightly charred and smoky, with those perfect little blistered spots that add depth of flavor.

While still hot from the grill, we slather the corn with a thin layer of Mexican mayonnaise, which acts as the perfect adhesive for our generous coating of crumbled cotija cheese. This salty, aged cheese is the authentic choice – accept no substitutes.

The final touches make all the difference: a dusting of chili powder (we use a blend of ancho and cayenne), a squeeze of fresh lime juice, and for those who dare, an extra sprinkle of our house-made chile-lime salt. Each bite is a perfect balance of sweet, salty, tangy, creamy, and spicy.

Served with extra lime wedges and napkins (you'll need them!), this messy, delicious treat is worth every bit of the inevitable chin-dripping experience. It's street food at its finest – unpretentious, flavorful, and absolutely addictive.
