Our black beans are proof that simple ingredients, treated with respect and patience, can create something extraordinary. We start with dried black beans, soaked overnight and then slow-cooked with white onion, garlic, and bay leaves until they're creamy and tender.

The secret ingredient is epazote, a traditional Mexican herb that adds an almost indescribable depth of flavor while making the beans easier to digest. We season them simply with sea salt and a touch of cumin, letting the earthy flavor of the beans shine through.

Served in a warm bowl and topped with crumbled queso fresco and a drizzle of Mexican crema, these beans are far more than just a side dish. They're comfort food that pairs perfectly with any of our tacos, or can stand alone as a satisfying vegetarian option.

We cook our beans fresh daily in small batches, never using canned beans or shortcuts. The difference is in every spoonful â€“ rich, creamy, and deeply satisfying. Don't forget to soak up the flavorful broth with our warm tortillas.
