Experience the theater of tableside guacamole, where our skilled servers prepare this classic right before your eyes. We start with perfectly ripe Haas avocados, checking each one for the ideal creamy texture that makes great guacamole.

Using a traditional molcajete (volcanic stone mortar), we muddle fresh garlic, jalapeño, and sea salt to release their essential oils. The avocados are added and gently mashed to your preferred texture – some like it smooth, others prefer it chunky. We fold in diced tomatoes, white onion, fresh cilantro, and finish with a generous squeeze of lime juice.

Our tortilla chips are made fresh throughout the day, cut from corn tortillas and fried until golden and crispy. Still warm and lightly salted, they're the perfect vehicle for our vibrant guacamole. The portion is generous enough to share, though you might not want to. This isn't just an appetizer – it's an experience.
