Our Mexican rice is the perfect companion to any meal – fluffy, flavorful, and never mushy. We start by toasting long-grain rice in a bit of oil until it's golden and fragrant, a crucial step that ensures each grain stays separate and develops a subtle nutty flavor.

The rice is then simmered in a rich broth made from pureed tomatoes, onions, and garlic, along with carrots and peas for pops of color and sweetness. We season it with cumin, a bay leaf, and fresh cilantro stems (saving the leaves for garnish), creating layers of flavor in every bite.

What makes our rice special is the technique – we never stir it once it starts simmering, allowing it to steam perfectly. The result is rice that's tender but not sticky, with each grain infused with the savory tomato broth. We finish with fresh cilantro leaves and a squeeze of lime juice for brightness.

This isn't the bland, yellow rice you'll find elsewhere. Our arroz rojo is a testament to the importance of technique and quality ingredients in Mexican cooking. It's the side dish that often steals the show.
