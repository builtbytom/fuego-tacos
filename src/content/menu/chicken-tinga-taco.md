Chicken Tinga is comfort food at its finest – tender, shredded chicken breast simmered in a rich, smoky sauce that's been perfected over generations. We slow-cook the chicken with fire-roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions, garlic, and chipotle peppers in adobo until it falls apart at the touch of a fork.

The sauce is the star here – a perfect balance of smoke, heat, and tang that clings to every strand of chicken. We pile it generously onto warm corn tortillas and top with cooling Mexican crema, crisp shredded lettuce, and thinly sliced radishes for a refreshing crunch.

The heat level is moderate but builds with each bite, thanks to the chipotle peppers. It's the kind of satisfying burn that keeps you coming back for more. This traditional recipe from Puebla has been in our family for three generations, and we're proud to share it with you.
