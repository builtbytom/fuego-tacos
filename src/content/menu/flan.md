Our flan is the ultimate comfort dessert – silky, smooth, and impossibly creamy. This classic Mexican custard is a study in simplicity and technique, requiring nothing more than eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla, transformed through careful cooking into something magical.

We start by making a deep amber caramel, cooking sugar until it's just at the edge of bitter – this complexity balances the sweet custard perfectly. The caramel is poured into individual molds where it hardens into a glassy layer.

The custard itself is enriched with both whole milk and sweetened condensed milk, giving it an incredibly lush texture. We use real vanilla beans, scraping the seeds into the mixture and infusing the milk with the pods for maximum flavor. The custard is strained multiple times to ensure absolute smoothness.

Baked in a water bath until just set with a gentle wobble in the center, then chilled overnight, our flan is unmolded to order. The caramel, now liquified, cascades down the sides creating a built-in sauce. Each spoonful melts on your tongue, cool and creamy with the bitter-sweet caramel providing the perfect counterpoint.

Simple, elegant, and utterly satisfying – this is the dessert Mexican grandmothers have been perfecting for generations, and we're honored to share our version with you.
