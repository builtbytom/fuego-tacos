Our vegetarian taco proves that plant-based can be just as satisfying as any meat option. We roast a medley of seasonal vegetables – bell peppers, zucchini, yellow squash, red onion, and mushrooms – with cumin, smoked paprika, and a touch of garlic until they're perfectly caramelized.

A layer of creamy refried black beans forms the base, topped with the smoky roasted vegetables. We add crumbled queso fresco for a salty contrast and finish with our house-made avocado crema – a silky blend of ripe avocados, lime juice, and cilantro.

Served on warm corn tortillas with a sprinkle of toasted pepitas for extra crunch, these tacos are a celebration of fresh produce and bold flavors. Even the most dedicated carnivores find themselves coming back for more. Naturally gluten-free and vegetarian, with vegan options available upon request.
